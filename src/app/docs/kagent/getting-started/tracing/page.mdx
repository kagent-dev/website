## Prerequisites

This guide walks you through all the steps you need to get started with tracing your kagent agents, including a basic installation. However, you might want to try out the other getting started guides first to get a better understanding of how kagent works.

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for creating and running a local Kubernetes cluster.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installing the kagent chart.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for interacting with your cluster.
- kagent CLI for interacting with kagent, such as to launch the dashboard.

  ```bash
  # Download/run the install script
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kagent-dev/kagent/refs/heads/main/scripts/get-kagent | bash
  ```

To run the AI agents you also need an [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API key. You can [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installing Jaeger

In order to demonstrate tracing, we'll first need to install Jaeger. We will use the Jaeger all in one mode to demonstrate the tracing capabilities without needing to install any other components.

Create the `jaeger.yaml` file using the following command:

```yaml
cat << 'EOF' > jaeger.yaml
provisionDataStore:
  cassandra: false
allInOne:
  enabled: true
storage:
  type: memory
agent:
  enabled: false
collector:
  enabled: false
query:
  enabled: false
EOF
```

Then install Jaeger using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger \
  --namespace jaeger \
  --create-namespace \
  --history-max 3 \
  --values jaeger.yaml
```

## Installing kagent

The following steps include commands to install or upgrade the kagent Helm release.

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. If you did not already, install the kagent CRDs.

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install kagent-crds oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent-crds \
       --namespace kagent \
       --create-namespace
   ```

3. If you already installed kagent, get your current Helm release values.

   ```shell
   helm get values kagent -n kagent > values.yaml
   ```

3. Create or update your values file to include the following settings to enable tracing.

   ```yaml
   otel:
     tracing:
       enabled: true
       exporter:
         otlp:
           endpoint: http://jaeger-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317
   ```

4. Install or upgrade the kagent Helm chart with the tracing details.

   ```bash
   helm upgrade -i kagent oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent \
       --namespace kagent \
       --set providers.openAI.apiKey=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
       --values values.yaml
   ```

## Tracing your first agent

Now that you installed kagent with Jaeger, learn how to trace requests to an agent.

### Generate tracing data

To generate tracing data, you can chat with a pre-configured agent such as `k8s-agent`. For more information about agents, see the [Your First Agent](/docs/kagent/getting-started/first-agent) guide.

1. Launch the kagent dashboard.

   ```bash
   kagent dashboard
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   kagent dashboard is available at http://localhost:8082
   Press Enter to stop the port-forward...
   ```

   ![kagent UI](/images/kagent-landing.png "Kagent dashboard main page")

2. Click the pre-configured `k8s-agent` agent.

3. In the conversation box, enter a query such as "What pods are running in my cluster?".

   ![kagent UI](/images/k8s-agent-query-light.png "Chatting with an agent")

### Review tracing data in Jaeger

Review the tracing data in Jaeger for the agent queries that you just sent.

1. In your terminal, enable port-forwarding for the Jaeger query service.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query -n jaeger 16686:16686
   ```

2. In your browser, open the Jaeger UI: [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

3. From the Jaeger **Search** menu, in the **Service** dropdown, select the `kagent` service. 

4. In the **Operation** dropdown, select `agent_run [k8s-agent]` to filter for traces specific to the agent.

5. Click **Find Traces**.

6. Review the traces for the `kagent` service.

7. Click on a trace to see more details.

That's it! You've now traced your first agent.
