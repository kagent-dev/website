# Prerequisites

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for creating and running a local Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - for installing the kagent chart
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - for interacting with your cluster

This guide will walk you through all the steps you need to get started with tracing your kagent agents. However, we recommend starting with the other getting-started guides first to get a better understanding of how kagent works.

To run the AI agents you'll also need an [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API key. You can [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installing Jaeger

In order to demonstrate tracing, we'll first need to install Jaeger. We will use the Jaeger all in one mode to demonstrate the tracing capabilities without needing to install any other components.

Firstly create a file called `jaeger.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
provisionDataStore:
  cassandra: false
allInOne:
  enabled: true
storage:
  type: memory
agent:
  enabled: false
collector:
  enabled: false
query:
  enabled: false
```

Then install Jaeger using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger \
  --namespace jaeger \
  --create-namespace \
  --history-max 3 \
  --values jaeger.yaml
```

## Installing kagent

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Install the Helm chart with CRDs:

```bash
helm install kagent-crds oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent-crds \
    --namespace kagent \
    --create-namespace
```
3. Create a file called `kagent-tracing.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
otel:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    exporter:
      otlp:
        endpoint: http://jaeger-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317
```

4. Install the kagent Helm chart:

```bash
helm install kagent oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent \
    --namespace kagent \
    --set providers.openAI.apiKey=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
    --values kagent-tracing.yaml
```

## Tracing your first agent

Now that we have Jaeger installed and kagent configured to use it, we can start tracing our first agent.

1. Download the kagent CLI:

```bash
# Download/run the install script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kagent-dev/kagent/refs/heads/main/scripts/get-kagent | bash
```

## Accessing the kagent dashboard (UI)

2. To open the kagent dashboard, run the dashboard command from the CLI

```bash
kagent dashboard
```

```console
kagent dashboard is available at http://localhost:8082
Press Enter to stop the port-forward...
```

The CLI will set up the port-forward to the service running inside the cluster and open the dashboard.

## Running the k8s-agent

Once you're in the kagent UI, you can start interacting with the pre-configured sample agents. You can click on the agent card to view the agent details and start a conversation. For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the `k8s-agent` agent. Specifically we'll use the `k8s-agent` agent to get the list of pods in the cluster. 

For testing purposes, we'll use the `k8s-agent` agent to get the list of pods in the cluster.

![kagent UI](/images/k8s-agent-query.png "Chatting with an agent")

Once that query is complete, we can go take a look at the data in Jaeger.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query -n jaeger 16686:16686
```

Once the port-forward is set up, you can open the Jaeger UI in your browser at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

From the Jaeger UI, select the `kagent` service on the top-left and then hit "search" to see the traces for the `k8s-agent` agent.

Specifically the result we're looking for should resemble the following:

![Jaeger UI](/images/jaeger-landing.png "Jaeger results page")

Once you've found the trace, you can click on it to see the details.

That's it! You've now traced your first agent.
