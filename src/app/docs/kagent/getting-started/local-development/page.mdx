# Local developmeent with kagent CLI

In this guide, you'll learn how to develop, build and run an AI agent locally using kagent CLI, without a Kubernetes cluster. This guide is meant for developers familiar with Python. You can also create declarative agents without writing a single line of code, by following the [Your First Agent](/docs/kagent/getting-started/first-agent) guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin make sure you have the following prerequisites installed: 

- [kagent CLI](/docs/kagent/introduction/installation)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


## Create a new agent

Let's create a new agent using the kagent CLI. We'll use the `gpt-4` model from OpenAI. You can use `--model-provider` to pick other providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic or Gemini).

```shell
kagent init adk python myagent --model-name gpt-4 --model-provider OpenAI
```

```console
‚úÖ Successfully created adk project in /projects/myagent
ü§ñ Model configuration for project: openai (gpt-4)
üìÅ Project structure:
   myagent/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myagent/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_tools.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-card.json
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kagent.yaml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   Note: MCP server directories are created when you run 'kagent add-mcp'

üöÄ Next steps:
   1. cd myagent
   2. Customize the agent in myagent/agent.py
   3. Build the agent and MCP servers and push it to the local registry
      kagent build myagent --push
   4. Run the agent locally
      kagent run
   5. Deploy the agent to your local cluster
      kagent deploy myagent --env-file .env.local
```

The main agent code will be be in the `agent.py` file. The sample agent has access two two tools - `roll_die` and `check_prime` - the first tool rools a die an returns the rolled result, while the second one checks if a given list of numbers is prime and returns the string indicating which numbers are prime.

Before you run the agent, you must set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Let's build the agent:

```shell
kagent build myagent
```

>Note the agent is automatically tagged with the `localhost:5001` registry, so make sure your Kubernetes cluster later on is configured to use this registry or push the image to a remote registry.

Now you can run the agent locally and test it out by running the following command from the `myagent` project directory:

```shell
cd myagent
kagent run
```

This will launch the terminal UI where you can interact with the agent.

![kagent terminal UI](/images/localdev-run-tui.png "kagent run terminal UI")

You can press CTRL+C to exit the terminal UI and stop the agent. If you make changes to the agent code, you can run `kagent build` and then `kagent run` again to see the changes.


## Add an MCP server to the agent

Now let's add an MCP server to the agent. We'll use the `sum` tool from the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything` MCP server. You can add an stdio or remote MCP server to the agent project using the `add-mcp` command. The `add-mcp` command has a terminal UI, but you can also pass specific arguments to the command:

```shell
kagent add-mcp server-everything --command npx --arg @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything 
```

This command adds an entry to the `kagent.yaml` file and creates a new directory in the `myagent` project directory called `server-everything`. The directory contains the agentgateway configuration file and a  `Dockerfile` for building the MCP server image.

>The configuration file and Dockerfile are only used for local development - when deploying the agent and MCP servers to a Kubernetes cluster, the MCP server will be deployed as a separate Kubernetes resource.

Whenever you add a new MCP server to the agent, the `docker-compose.yaml` file is updated to include the new MCP server. For example, after adding the above MCP server, the entry for it in the `docker-compose.yaml` file will look like this:

```yaml
  server-everything:
    image: localhost:5001/myagent-server-everything:latest
    build:
      context: ./server-everything
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    expose:
      - "3000"
```

By default, all tools from the MCP server will be automatically available and added to the agent. You can also filter the tools by name or by using a predicate. For example, to only add the `add` tool, you can modify the `agent.py` file like this:


```python
mcp_tools = get_mcp_tools(server_filters={"server-everything": ["add"]})
```

This will only include the `add` tool from the `server-everything` MCP server. Let's rebuild the project using `kagent build` and then run the agent again using `kagent run`:

```console
You: what can you do?                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                        
Agent:                                                                                                                                  
As myagent_agent, I have several capabilities. Here are some of the things I can do:                                                    
                                                                                                                                        
1. Roll dice of different sizes: You specify the number of sides, and I can roll a die with that many sides.                            
                                                                                                                                        
2. Check if numbers are prime: After rolling a die or dice, I can check if the outcomes of the rolls are prime numbers.                 
                                                                                                                                        
3. Add numbers: I can perform addition operations as well.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
In order to achieve these, I employ tools to perform specific functions like roll_die, check_prime, or add. I'm here to help, so feel   
free to ask me to perform any of these tasks!                                                                                           
```

The agent has access to the `add` tool as it specified in the response to the user query. You can also try asking the agent to add two numbers, for example `add 2 + 2` and see if it works.

## Deploying the project to a Kubernetes cluster

Now let's deploy the project to a Kubernetes cluster. We'll use the `kagent deploy` command to deploy the agent and MCP servers to a Kubernetes cluster. Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster and kagent installed in it. 

We'll preprate a `.env.production` file and include the OpenAI API key in it:

```shell
cat << EOF > .env.production
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
EOF
```

When deploying, we'll reference the `.env.production` file using the `--env-file` flag and the CLI will create a Secret with the API key (and any other environment variables defined in the file) and then include them in the Agent resource.

Let's try the `--dry-run` flag to see what will be deployed. As our agent depends on an OpenAI API key, we need to provide it using the `--api-key` flag:

```shell
kagent deploy . --env-file .env.production --dry-run
```

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: PHlvdXItYXBpLWtleT4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myagent-env
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: myagent
  namespace: default
spec:
  byo:
    deployment:
      env:
      - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            key: OPENAI_API_KEY
            name: myagent-env
      image: localhost:5001/myagent:latest
  type: BYO
status:
  observedGeneration: 0
---
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: server-everything
  namespace: default
spec:
  deployment:
    args:
    - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything'
    cmd: npx
    image: node:24-alpine3.21
    port: 3000
  stdioTransport: {}
  transportType: stdio
status: {}
```

Note that the Agent image is tagged with the `localhost:5001` registry, so make sure you have either a local Docker registry running or push the image to a remote registry and then modify the agent image tag. You can also use `kagent build myagent --image ghcr.io/myorg/my-agent:v1.0.0 --push` to build the image with a specifiy name and also push it to a remote registry.

To deploy both the agent and MCP servers to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the same `deploy` command, but omit the `--dry-run` flag:

```shell
kagent deploy . --env-file .env.production
```

The command will rebuild the images and then create and deploy the Agent and MCPServer resources to the Kubernetes cluster. 

```shell
kubectl get agent,mcpserver
```

```console
NAME                       TYPE   READY   ACCEPTED
agent.kagent.dev/myagent   BYO    True    True

NAME                                     READY   AGE
mcpserver.kagent.dev/server-everything   True    112s
```

You can now test the deployed agent and the MCP server through kagent UI.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, you can start by checking the logs from the agent and/or MCP server containers. You can check the running containers using `docker ps` command and then use the `docker logs [container_id]` command to view the logs from individual container.
