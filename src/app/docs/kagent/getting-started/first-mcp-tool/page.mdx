# Adding MCP Tools to Your First Kagent Agent

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) tools extend the agent's abilities by calling external services to perform tasks that require logic or access outside the cluster.

In this guide, you'll learn how to add an MCP tool to your first AI agent using the kagent resources.

## Prerequisites

1. Install kagent in a Kubernetes cluster. If you haven't done this yet, check out the [installation guide](/docs/kagent/introduction/installation) or the [quickstart guide](/docs/kagent/getting-started/quickstart).

2. Make sure that you have the kagent custom resources in your cluster.

   ```shell
   kubectl get crd | grep kagent.dev
   ```

## Creating an agent

To create an agent, follow the [Your First Agent guide](/docs/kagent/getting-started/first-agent).

Take a look at the Agent custom resource for your first agent, such as with the following command.

```shell
kubectl get agent my-first-k8s-agent -n kagent -o yaml
```

Example output: Pay attention to the following details:

* The `type` field is set to `Declarative`. This means that the agent is using a declarative model configuration and system message, as opposed to `BYO` where you can bring your own agent configuration separately.
* The `declarative` field contains the model configuration and system message.
* The `systemMessage` field contains the system message that the agent will use. Note that the way you structure your instructions is up to you. You can add more details, or simplify them as needed. It's important to make sure the instructions are clear and easy to follow.
* The `tools` field contains the tools that the agent can run to interact with the environment. The tools refer to a RemoteMCPServer, because these tools are built in to kagent. However, you can also create your own MCPServer or regular Kubernetes Service and designate the Service as for MCP use.
* The `status` shows that the agent is accepted and ready.

      You're a friendly and helpful agent that uses Kubernetes tools to answer users questions about the cluster.
  
      # Instructions
      - If user question is unclear, ask for clarification before running any tools
      - Always be helpful and friendly
      - If you don't know how to answer the question DO NOT make things up
        respond with "Sorry, I don't know how to answer that" and ask the user to further clarify the question
        If you are unable to help, or something goes wrong, refer the user to https://kagent.dev for more information or support.

## Configuring MCP tools

Now that you've reviewed an existing agent that uses MCP tools, let's create our own from scratch.

The following example creates an agent that can retrieve information from a website. You create a [simple MCP example server](https://github.com/peterj/mcp-website-fetcher/pkgs/container/mcp-website-fetcher) that only has one tool, the fetch tool. The fetch tool takes a URL as input and returns the contents of the page.

1. Create a Deployment for the MCP server.

   ```yaml 
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: mcp-website-fetcher
     namespace: kagent
     labels:
       app: mcp-website-fetcher
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: mcp-website-fetcher
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: mcp-website-fetcher
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: mcp-website-fetcher
             image: ghcr.io/peterj/mcp-website-fetcher:sha-d2db5b3
             imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8000
             resources:
               limits:
                 cpu: "500m"
                 memory: "256Mi"
               requests:
                 cpu: "100m"
                 memory: "128Mi"
             livenessProbe:
               httpGet:
                 path: /sse
                 port: 8000
               initialDelaySeconds: 10
               periodSeconds: 30
   EOF
   ```

2. Create a Service with special configuration that designates the Service as an MCP server for kagent to process.

   * Label: Add the `kagent.dev/mcp-service: "true"` label to the Service so that kagent can discover the tools for the Service.
   * App protocol: In the `spec.ports` section, set the `appProtocol: mcp`. You must set this field for kagent to pick up the Service as an MCP server.
   * Annotations: You can use the following annotations to further configure the your MCP Service.
     * `kagent.dev/mcp-service-path`: Set the path on which the MCP server lives. The default value is `/mcp`.
     * `kagent.dev/mcp-service-port`: Set the port number to be used. No port is set by default.
     * `kagent.dev/mcp-service-protocol`: Set the protocol to use. Accepted values are SSE or STREAMABLE_HTTP. The default value is STREAMABLE_HTTP.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: mcp-website-fetcher
     namespace: kagent
     labels:
       kagent.dev/mcp-service: "true"
     annotations:
       kagent.dev/mcp-service-path: /sse
       kagent.dev/mcp-service-port: "8000"
       kagent.dev/mcp-service-protocol: SSE
   spec:
     selector:
       app: mcp-website-fetcher
     ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8000
     type: ClusterIP
   EOF
   ```

3. Create an Agent resource. Note that in the `tools` section, you refer to the MCP Service that you just created. One tool is included, the fetch tool. Even if the MCP server has multiple tools, you can decide which tools to include for this particular agent. The tool takes a single input parameter: the URL to fetch. You do not have to include the input schema, however. Kagent automatically discovers the input schema from the tool itself.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
   kind: Agent
   metadata:
     name: simple-fetch-agent
     namespace: kagent
   spec:
     description: This agent can use a single tool to retrieve the contents of a webpage.
     type: Declarative
     declarative:
       modelConfig: default-model-config
       systemMessage: |-
         You're a friendly and helpful agent that uses the fetch tool to retrieve webpage contents.
     
         # Instructions
     
         - If user question is unclear, ask for clarification before running any tools
         - Always be helpful and friendly
         - If you don't know how to answer the question DO NOT make things up
           respond with "Sorry, I don't know how to answer that" and ask the user to further clarify the question
     
         # Response format
         - ALWAYS format your response as Markdown
         - Your response will include a summary of actions you took and an explanation of the result
       tools:
       - type: McpServer
         mcpServer:
           name: mcp-website-fetcher
           kind: Service
           toolNames:
           - fetch
   EOF
   ```

## Testing the agent with the MCP tool

Now let's try our agent out with the fetch tool. 

1. Open the kagent dashboard.

   ```shell
   kagent dashboard
   ```

2. Select the **simple-fetch-agent** that you just created. Under **Agent Details**, you see the **fetch** tool.

3. In the chat box, enter `"Show me the contents of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_mesh website?"` and click **Send**. The agent responds with the contents of the website.
