Remove kagent from your Kubernetes cluster using the kagent CLI or Helm.

> **Warning**: Uninstalling kagent deletes all kagent resources across all namespaces in your cluster, including agents, tools, and configurations. This action cannot be undone.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that you have administrative access to your cluster.
- Back up any agent configurations or data that you want to preserve.
- Review any agents or tools that depend on kagent before uninstalling.

## Uninstall with the kagent CLI

Remove kagent by using the CLI. For more options, see the [`kagent uninstall` command reference](/docs/kagent/resources/cli/kagent-uninstall).

```bash
kagent uninstall
```

Example output:

```console
kagent uninstalled successfully
```

## Uninstall with Helm

To uninstall kagent using Helm, remove the Helm releases in the correct order.

1. Uninstall the kagent chart.

   ```bash
   helm uninstall kagent -n kagent
   ```

2. Remove all kagent CRDs and resources across your cluster.

   ```bash
   helm uninstall kagent-crds -n kagent
   ```
