# Bringing your own A2A agent to kagent with ADK

Bring your own custom agents. Currently, custom agents must be built with the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). Such frameworks give you more control over the agent behavior and are well-suited for complex workflows and integration with external systems and APIs.

Unlike declarative agents that are defined by kagent resources with components such as system instructions, models, and tools written inline, these BYO agents give you full control over agent logic. If you have your own agent, no need to decompose its functions into separate kagent resources. Kagent can invoke your agent directly through the A2A protocol.

## Prerequisites

Install kagent by following the [quick start](/docs/kagent/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## Building a custom agent

The following example builds a simple agent from the [kagent code repository](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent). The sample app is built with Google's ADK framework and performs two basic tasks: rolls a die with a specified number of sides and determines whether a number in a list is prime. It uses Google's Gemini model as the underlying LLM provider.

1. Clone the kagent code repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent.git
   ```

2. From the root directory, build the kagent-adk image and push it to your local Docker registry. If you do not have a Docker registry, you can use the `make helm-install` command to create one as part of installing kagent in your kind cluster.

   ```bash
   make build-kagent-adk
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   => => pushing manifest for localhost:5001/kagent-dev/kagent/kagent-adk:v0.5.5-9-g7c3a48c@sha256:084280184b398d56c787e51d1fef33002402364
   ```

3. From the output of the previous step, tag and push the image as `latest`.

   ```bash
   docker tag localhost:5001/kagent-dev/kagent/kagent-adk:v0.5.5-9-g7c3a48c@sha256:084280184b398d56c787e51d1fef33002402364 localhost:5001/kagent-dev/kagent/kagent-adk:latest
   docker push localhost:5001/kagent-dev/kagent/kagent-adk:latest
   ```

4. Build the custom agent image and push it to your local Docker registry.

   ```bash
   cd python/samples/adk/basic
   docker build . -t localhost:5001/my-byo:latest \
     --build-arg DOCKER_REGISTRY=localhost:5001 \
     --build-arg VERSION=latest \
     --push
   ```

## Creating a BYO Agent resource 

Now that you have your own custom agent image, you can create a BYO Agent resource for kagent to manage.

1. Save the API key for your LLM provider, such as Gemini, in an environment variable.

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

2. Create a secret with the API key.

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic kagent-google -n kagent  --from-literal=GOOGLE_API_KEY=$GOOGLE_API_KEY   --dry-run=client -oyaml | k apply -f -
   ```

3. Create a BYO Agent resource.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
   kind: Agent
   metadata:
     name: basic-agent
     namespace: kagent
   spec:
     description: This agent can do anything.
     type: BYO
     byo:
       deployment:
         image: localhost:5001/my-byo:latest
         env:
           - name: GOOGLE_API_KEY
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: kagent-google
                 key: GOOGLE_API_KEY
   EOF
   ```

## Testing the A2A endpoint

The A2A endpoint is exposed on the port `8083` of the kagent controller service.

1. Enable port-forwarding on the `kagent-controller` service.

   >Note that you could also expose the A2A endpoint publicly by using a gateway.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/kagent-controller 8083:8083 -n kagent
   ```

2. To test that the agent is available and has an agent card, send a request to the `.well-known/agent.json` endpoint. Note the API endpoint follows the pattern `/api/a2a/{namespace}/{agent-name}/.well-known/agent.json`.

   ```bash
   curl localhost:8083/api/a2a/kagent/basic-agent/.well-known/agent.json
   ```

   Example output: This JSON object describes the agent as per the [A2A protocol](https://a2a.guide/protocol/agent-card.html).

   ```json
   {
     "name": "basic_agent",
     "description": "This agent can do anything.",
     "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8083/api/a2a/kagent/basic-agent/",
     "version": "",
     "capabilities": {
       "streaming": true,
       "pushNotifications": false,
       "stateTransitionHistory": true
     },
     "defaultInputModes": [
       "text"
     ],
     "defaultOutputModes": [
       "text"
     ],
     "skills": []
   }
   ```

## Invoking the agent

You can invoke the agent in several ways, including the kagent dashboard, kagent CLI, and the A2A host CLI.

### Dashboard

Launch the dashboard with `kagent dashboard`, find your `basic-agent`, and start chatting. For complete steps, see the [Your First Agent](/docs/kagent/getting-started/first-agent) guide.

![BYO Agent](/images/byo-basic.png "Chat with your basic agent")

### kagent CLI

To use the kagent CLI, make sure that the controller is still being port-forwarded.

Then, use the invoke command. For more options, run `kagent help invoke`.

```shell
kagent invoke --agent basic-agent --task "Roll a die with 6 sides"
```

Example output: The output includes both the response as well as the details of the response. The formatting is in JSON but can be quite long, depending on the call and the agent configuration.

```json
{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "artifactId": "2d44a62e-d079-4dae-8ee8-f8759add9ffe",
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "I rolled a 4 on the 6-sided die.\n"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
...
```

### A2A host CLI

You can use the A2A host CLI to invoke the agent. This CLI is part of the [A2A samples repository](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/hosts/cli).

1. Clone the A2A samples repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples.git
   ```

2. From the `a2a-samples/samples/python/hosts/cli` directory, point the CLI to the kagent endpoint.

   ```bash
   cd a2a-samples/samples/python/hosts/cli
   uv run . --agent http://127.0.0.1:8083/api/a2a/kagent/basic-agent
   ```

   Example output: The CLI connects to the kagent, displays the agent card and prompts you for input.

   ```console
   ======= Agent Card ========
   {"capabilities":{"pushNotifications":false,"stateTransitionHistory":true,"streaming":true},"defaultInputModes":["text"],"defaultOutputModes":["text"],"description":"This agent can do anything.","name":"basic_agent","protocolVersion":"0.2.6","skills":[],"url":"http://127.0.0.1:8083/api/a2a/kagent/basic-agent/","version":""}
   =========  starting a new task ======== 
   
   What do you want to send to the agent? (:q or quit to exit): 
   ```

3. Send the task `"Roll a die with 6 sides"` to the agent. You'll be also prompted to optionally attach a file to the request, but just hit enter to skip this step. 

   Example output: You get a stream of events that include the prompt and the agent's response, such as the following.

   ```json
