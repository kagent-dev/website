# Launch the UI

Access the kagent dashboard to manage your agents, tools, and monitor your kagent installation. You can open the dashboard using either the kagent CLI command or by manually port-forwarding the kagent UI service.

## Before you begin

Make sure that kagent is installed in your cluster and the kagent UI service is running. Verify the service exists:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n kagent kagent-ui
```

## Launch the UI with the CLI

The easiest way to launch the kagent dashboard is by using the `kagent dashboard` command. This command automatically sets up port-forwarding and opens the dashboard in your browser.

1. Run the dashboard command:

   ```bash
   kagent dashboard
   ```

   The command port-forwards the `kagent-ui` service to `localhost:8082` and opens the dashboard in your default browser.

2. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8082`.

3. Press Enter in the terminal to stop the port-forward when you're done.

> **Note**: The `kagent dashboard` command is currently available on macOS. On other platforms, use the manual port-forwarding method described below.

## Launch the UI with port-forwarding

If you prefer to manually set up port-forwarding, or if you're on a platform where the CLI command isn't available, you can port-forward the service yourself.

1. Port-forward the `kagent-ui` service to your local machine:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n kagent service/kagent-ui 8082:8080
   ```

   This command forwards port 8080 from the service to port 8082 on your local machine.

2. In your browser, open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

3. When you're finished, stop the port-forward by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the port-forward is running.
