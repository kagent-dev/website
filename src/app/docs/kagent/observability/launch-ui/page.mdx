# Launch the UI

Access the kagent dashboard to manage your agents, tools, and models. You can open the dashboard by using the kagent CLI command or by port-forwarding the kagent UI service.

## Before you begin

Make sure that kagent is installed in your cluster and the kagent UI service is running.

```bash
kubectl get svc -n kagent kagent-ui
```

## Launch the UI with the CLI

The easiest way to launch the kagent dashboard is by using the `kagent dashboard` command. This command automatically sets up port-forwarding and opens the dashboard in your browser.

> **Note**: The `kagent dashboard` command is currently available on macOS. On other platforms, use the port-forwarding method described in the next section.

1. Run the dashboard command:

   ```bash
   kagent dashboard
   ```

   The command port-forwards the `kagent-ui` service to `localhost:8082` and opens the dashboard in your default browser.

2. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8082`.

3. When you're done, press `Enter` in the terminal to stop the port-forward.

## Launch the UI with port-forwarding

If you prefer to manually set up port-forwarding, or if you're on a platform where the `kagent` CLI isn't available, you can port-forward the service yourself.

1. Port-forward the `kagent-ui` service to your local machine. The following command forwards port 8080 from the service to port 8082 on your local machine.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n kagent service/kagent-ui 8082:8080
   ```   

2. In your browser, open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

3. When you're done, stop the port-forward by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the port-forward is running.
