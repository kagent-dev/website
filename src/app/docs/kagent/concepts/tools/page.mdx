# Tools

Tools are functions that the agent can use to interact with its environment. For example, a Kubernetes agent might have tools to list pods, get pod logs, and describe services.

Kagent comes with a set of built-in tools that you can use to interact with your environment. Kagent also supports the MCP (Model Configuration Protocol) tools. Using MCP, you can bring any external tool into kagent and make it available for your agents to run.

## Built-in Tools

You can check out the full list of built-in tools [here](/tools).

The built-in tools are meant as a good starting point for any agents running in kubernetes, however we don't envision them covering all possible use-cases, so we support multiple tool extension points to allow you to bring in your own tools.

## Agents as Tools

You also have an option of using agents as tools. Any agent you create can be referenced and used by other agents you have.

## MCP Tools

MCP stands for [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It is a protocol, originally created by Anthropic, which is meant as a flexible way to provide tools and other information to Agents. In the year or so since its inception, it has begun to gain traction and more and more tools are adopting it. The [servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) repository has a list of MCP servers that you can use immediately with kagent! Of course there are more than just the ones listed there, so we also support bringing in your own MCP servers.

**Note:** Double check any community servers before running them in your environment.

## HTTP Tools

HTTP tools are another way to bring external tools into kagent. Simply put, given a URL and a schema, kagent will send the user query to the URL and return the response. Kagent has the ability to discovery HTTP tools from services running in the cluster, assuming they are OpenAPI Compliant.
