# Install the kmcp controller

The kmcp controller manages the lifecycle of MCP servers that are defined in an MCPServer custom resource. 

## Prerequisites

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) for creating and running a local Kubernetes cluster
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for running local kind clusters
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installing the kmcp controller chart

## Install the controller

1. Create a kind cluster. 
   
   **Tip**: If you already have a Kubernetes cluster that you want to use, switch to the kubeconfig context for that cluster by using the `kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT-NAME]` command. 
   ```sh
   kind create cluster
   ```

2. Install the following kmcp controller components in your cluster. 
   * The MCPServer Custom Resource Definition to define your MCP server. 
   * The ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to control RBAC permissions for the kmcp controller.
   * The kmcp controller deployment that automatically manages the lifecycle of MCPServer resources. 
   
   ```sh
   kmcp install
   ``` 
   
   Example output: 
   ```sh

   NAME: kmcp
   LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jul 30 18:41:01 2025
   NAMESPACE: kmcp-system
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   TEST SUITE: None
   ✅ KMCP controller deployed successfully
   💡 Check controller status with: kubectl get pods -n kmcp-system
   💡 View controller logs with: kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kmcp -n kmcp-system
   ```
   
3. Verify that the kmcp controller manager is up and running. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n kmcp-system
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```sh
   NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kmcp-controller-manager-66c8764c66-8h5sl   1/1     Running   0          27h
   ```
   
4. Optional: Look at the logs of the kmcp controller manager. 
   ```sh
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kmcp -n kmcp-system
   ```
